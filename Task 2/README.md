# Task 2 - Data Insights

In this task, with the help of the same dataset, we have to explore the data, analyze it and develop the strategies to develop models and interpretations. The client wants us to present the findings as a presentation so that in the next task we can proceed to develop dashboards for the same.

The three main parts of the presentation are :
1. Data Exploration
2. Model Development
3. Interpretation

After finding the strategies and insights for all the above three parts, they should be presented in the form of presentation as uploaded.

## Note : Do not copy the presentation without being involved with the intership.
