# Task 1 - Data Quality Assessment

In this task, we are provided with the necessary datasets. As said, the quality of the dataset need not be underestimated. The improved quality can make potential customers get attracted and drive business revenue.

So, in this task, we are required to analyze the dataset carefully and identify the issues with the datasets that may seem to be an obstacle to reach potential customers. The datasets should be checked for standard data quality measures like:
  1. Accuracy
  2. Completeness
  3. Consistency
  4. Currency
  5. Relevancy
  6. Validity
  7. Uniqueness

After identifying the potential issues in the datasets, the strategies to mitigate it are developed. Then, these are to be presented to the client in the form of email.
